## MasterVal

The purpose of the tool was to facilitate the selection of master's courses for students studying media technology at Link√∂ping University. Since the students themselves choose the courses in their master's, it is also up to them themselves to ensure that they meet the requirements. The tool thus helps by validating the courses at the same time as it contributes with a good overview of the choice, something that the students usually must do in self-created excel files. For this project we decided to try out ASP.NET Core with an MVC structure for the first time and together with this we used React, MongoDB and Firebase for management of users.
